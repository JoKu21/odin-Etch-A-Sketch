# odin-Etch-A-Sketch

In this project, I'm going to create a browser version of something
between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

At this point, I will use all the skills and tools I learned during the course
so far. 

********** Assignment **********

1. Create a webpage 16x16 grid of square divs
1.1. Use JS to create the grid
1.2. Put the grid into a container (div, that can be written to index.html)
1.3. To solve this, use
        - float/clear
        - inline-block
        - flexbox
        - CSS grid (wasn't tought yet)
1.4. Be careful with borders and margins

2. Set a "hover"-effect, so that grid divs change color, when mouse passes over them.
2.1. changing color
        - adding a new class to the div
        - changing the div's background color with JS

3. Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
3.1. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide)
3.2. Set the limit of the users input to 100.
3.3. button
        - research button tags in HTML and how you can make a JS function run when one is clicked
        - check out prompts
        - you should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used

Extra:
a. use a random color for hover change
